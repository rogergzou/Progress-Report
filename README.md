Thank you so much for using Track This Moment! If you liked it and have a moment, perhaps leave us a review? We really appreciate it.

What's New in this Version:

 Categories replace AutoFills! Categories have same functionality, but allow event titles to be custom and still fall under a general category for activity logging purposes.
